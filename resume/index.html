        <h2>Relative Experience</h2>
        <h3>Inspirit A.I: Researcher/Programmer</h3>
        <p>Inspirit A.I is a mentorship program where individuals are paired with industry professionals to collaborate on
            research projects. My project used an in-depth dataset on air pollutant levels across the United States with the
            end goal of creating a predictive model to forecast future pollutant levels in a given city.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I worked with Seaborn, Matplotlib, Pandas, and NumPy to analyze and visualize the dataset.</li>
            <li>Applied practical application of filtration techniques (Querying, Feature Engineering/Selection),
                Seasonal Decomposition, Data Smoothing.</li>
            <li>Split, trained, and tested SARIMA, ARIMA, and Prophet models with hyperparameter tuning to make
                predictions.</li>
            <li>Authored a research article published on Medium titled &#39;O3 OH NO: Time-Based Machine Learning
                Model to Predict Ozone Levels in New York City,&#39; where I showcased my findings and methodologies.</li>
